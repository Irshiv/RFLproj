        <h1>Mission</h1>

				<p>Our mission is to help people be happy by eating healthy and tasty, spending less time preparing food, and making it fun.</p>

				<h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>People who are eating healthy and tasty food have more energy to have more quality of life, making their life not only rational but fun and happy.</p>


				<blockquote><p>Our mission is to improve people's life by equipping them with useful tools. Health is one of the more important things which can bring people to the happy or sad side of life. Someone said that we are it is what we eat. Thus, when people eat healthier food, they are healthier, so they can have more time to do fun stuff what they want to do instead of thinking about how to improve their health. So, more health, more energy for life, more cool things to do.
                    However, usually healthy food is required much money to go to better restaurants or required spending a lot of time planning, finding, buying, preparing, and decorating daily meals. Also, going to an expensive restaurant is not always to eat healthy food. Definitely, It will be tasty but not definitely healthy. So, choosing restaurants is not always the better choice. 
                    So, our solution helps people eat healthily and spend less time on food preparation. It will be possible due to the weekly/monthly meals plan, with grocery purchases list, buying online, and video guidance on how to cook food and decorate a table.</p></blockquote>
